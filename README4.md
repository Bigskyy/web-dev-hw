I took a look at the The Wayback Machine and it was like a blast from the past. I looked up an old website for a daily newspaper I read faithfully daily, The Daily Mail. The photo and story I found was dated back to 2004 and was about the Alzheimer's drug, Aricept. The over-all-look was dated and was quite dull in comparison to todays, polished and digitally enhanced world of the World Wide Web.

I want to like GitHub and Atom, very much, but I am struggling and with the new introduction version of GitHub Desktop, I will be in touch with you as soon as I finish this README, in order to schedule a time to meet with you.

Thank you.
