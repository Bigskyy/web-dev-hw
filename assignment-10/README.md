# Briefly share your design process for this assignment. What fonts did you choose, and why?
I played around with several ideas of what to use as a story and decided on The War of the Worlds as it is free on Gutenberg, and also that I could probably find a couple of cool fonts to go with it.

# What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font? What is the importance of saving fallback fonts or a font stack?
A system font is a font used by the computers operating system.  A web font is a special type of font created just for web use in CSS. Web-safe fonts are fonts that many operating systems already have installed. Fallback fonts are important in case your fonts aren't web-friendly and to provide a worst case font selection.

# Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
Picked a story, read the assignments, studied fonts on the web and Google fonts, and played with a couple of layouts until I found someting that I thought looked good.
