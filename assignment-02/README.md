 Assignment 2
Marcia H. Heydt

My decision to take Intro to Web Design is due in part to my desire to learn as much as possible in the realm of the World Wide Web. WWW has changed greatly over the last 25 years. I first started researching projects for a Fortune 100 Company on the WWW and never imagined we would be where we are today, in regards to obtaining information on any subject matter. Life is supposed to be easier with the instant info provided by the Web, however, as I see it; life is easier for those who make the decision to follow along closely, learn as much as possible, and hone in on personal skills to understand the Web and keep current with your skill set. Things on the Web change rapidly and only those who make the conscience decision to stay on top of their technical skills, are the survivors.

I hope to learn:
1. How to set up a website.
2. How to understand Web Development
