# Final Assignment
## Marcia Heydt

# Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?
I learned how to embed mp4 video with the <video> tag.

# Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?
I was excited and apprehensive about putting this together, but with what I learned in the other lessons, this was a straightforward.  I didn't necessarily learn anything new in this lesson because I was taught it so well earlier in the course. :)

# Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
I reviewed everything I did and decided to build a site based on my previous assignments template, but added personal pages and addition pictures, video and text.
