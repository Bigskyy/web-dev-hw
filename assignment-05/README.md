1. ****How many document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?****
    You can only have one <head> and <body> element per page. The head elements tell the browser and processor information about the HTML document, such as the title, author, and publication date. The body element is where all of the content or a page is placed
2. ****Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.****
    Structural markup are things like headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists. Semantic markup are things like making things bold, italicized, or underlining them. Semantics are important when needing to emphasize a word or sentence.
3. ****Work Summary****
    I think I'm starting to get the hang of this.  HTML is interesting.  The book by Jon Duckett helps too as it shows you visually how this works.
