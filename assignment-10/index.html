  <h3>I. THE EVE OF THE WAR.</h3>
  <div>
    No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century
    that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences
    greater than manâ€™s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied
    themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and
    studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might
    scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of
    water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe
    about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire
    over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do
    the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources
    of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life
    upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of
    the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men
    fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to
    themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the
    gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the
    beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic,
    regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their
    plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great
    disillusionment.

    The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the
    sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it
    receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It
    must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world;
    and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface
    must have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of
    the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the
    temperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and all
    that is necessary for the support of animated existence.
