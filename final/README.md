## Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?
My future dog breeding firm

## What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?
* Display:inline - forces the property to act like and inline element and only takes up as much space as it needs to, doesn't force new lines, flows with content on the screen which means it doesn't respect the margin properties, and it can't change distance vertically or horizontally between itself and other elements.
* display:inline-block - removes new lines that block elements but also forces elements to respect the margin and vertical spacing rules. These elements will fill the parent container so a specific width must be set
* display:block - can be used to turn inline elements into block elements, this element is used when you need to create vertical navigation bars out of lists.

## Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
Decided on what my company would be and since were looking to breed our dog I made this be a future page for them.
Then I laid out the pages and started inserting the divs for the major sections.  From there I referenced styles and made the site look great.
